# Preprint: Surrogate Learning of Scour-critical Bridge Capacities and Uncertainty Quantification Considering Climate Scenarios

## Significance and Contributions

### Problem Addressed
Scour-critical bridges represent a dominant failure mode in transportation infrastructure, with risk amplified by nonstationary hydrologic forcing under climate change. Existing bridge fragility and risk frameworks rely on stationary assumptions, single-scenario projections, or precise probabilistic inputs that are unjustified under deep climate uncertainty. This creates structurally overconfident risk estimates and undermines resilient asset management.

### Core Contribution
The paper introduces a **surrogate-based, imprecise-probability fragility framework** for bridge scour that explicitly accounts for **climate scenario uncertainty** and **hydraulic–structural model uncertainty** without requiring unjustifiable probabilistic precision.

### Methodological Advances
- Develops a **computationally efficient surrogate model** for coupled flood–scour–structure response, enabling large-scale risk evaluation infeasible with full physics-based simulations.
- Formulates **fragility relationships using credal bounds** rather than single-valued probabilities, capturing irreducible uncertainty across climate scenarios.
- Integrates **multiple climate pathways** into fragility assessment without collapsing them into ensemble means or weighted averages.
- Treats scour depth as an epistemically uncertain input, propagating uncertainty consistently through structural capacity estimates.

### Scientific Significance
- Replaces false probabilistic certainty with **defensible uncertainty bounds**, aligning risk modeling with the actual state of climate knowledge.
- Demonstrates that climate-driven variability can dominate fragility estimates, invalidating stationary or single-scenario bridge assessments.
- Establishes a rigorous bridge between **climate science uncertainty** and **structural reliability analysis**, an interface typically handled heuristically.

### Practical Impact
- Provides transportation agencies with **decision-relevant risk envelopes** instead of fragile point estimates.
- Enables prioritization and retrofit planning under uncertainty without requiring subjective probability assignments.
- Supports resilient infrastructure management by exposing where risk assessments are sensitive, indeterminate, or robust.

### Conceptual Advancement
The work reframes infrastructure fragility analysis from a prediction problem to a **bounded inference problem under deep uncertainty**, setting a precedent for climate-aware structural risk assessment beyond bridges.
